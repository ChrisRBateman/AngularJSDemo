Some simple web apps I wrote using AngularJS. The demos are listed below with a
description of what each does.

------ 
Anything a user types is shown in a label tag.

Exec02
------ 
Creates a simple table with data from customer.json file. Table is sorted by age.

Exec03

Creates a simple table with data from http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/last/results.json.
Table is sorted by rank.

Exec04
------
Creates a simple TODO list.

Exec05

Uses <b>Routing</b> to transition from a customer list page to a customer detail page. Data is from
the customer.json file.
